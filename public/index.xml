      <description>What is this? This is my blog page where I might or might not post interesting stuff that I have learned through my time.&#xA;Building process I build this page with HUGO, a framework that offers a diverse set of templates to create a page of your own. I got a domain from porkbun.com and then hosted using GitHub pages.&#xA;Everything is very straightforward, after downloading the dependencies, which is only, Go and the HUGO framework itself.</description>
