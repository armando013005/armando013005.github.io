<p>This is my blog page where I might or might not post interesting stuff that I have learned through my time.</p>
<h3 id="building-process">Building process</h3>
<p>I build this page with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a>, a framework that offers a diverse set of templates to create a page of your own. I got a domain from <a href="https://porkbun.com">porkbun.com</a> and then hosted using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> pages.</p>
<p>Everything is very straightforward, after downloading the <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/#prerequisites">dependencies</a>, which is only, Go and the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> framework itself.</p>
<p>I installed the HUGO framework by <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> and ran the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>choco install hugo-extended
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>after this and of course with git pre-installed I ran a command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new site YOUR SITE NAME
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd quickstart
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git init
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git submodule add &#34;YOUR THEME REPO&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo &#34;theme = &#39;THEME NAME&#39;&#34; &gt;&gt; hugo.toml
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo server
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is important to mention that sometimes the line</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo &#34;theme = &#39;THEME NAME&#39;&#34; &gt;&gt; hugo.toml
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Does not work, because for some reason the console will take the symbol &rsquo; as a Unicode symbol, and it will write trash in the created file, so manual modification is required. Just write inside the <code>hugo.toml</code> file <code>theme = 'THEME NAME'</code> inside, obviously replace &ldquo;THEME NAME&rdquo; with the name of the theme you are using.</p>
<h3 id="creating-posts">Creating posts</h3>
<p>Creating a post in HUGO is as easy as creating the file. Content in HUGO works with markdown files which later are translated by HUGO to HTML.</p>
<p>You only need one command, and know <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a>, which is very intuitive. I know pretty sure that LaTeX is also <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/mathematics/">supported</a> but is something that I have not tried.</p>
<p>To start a new post the command is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new create content/myPost.md
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There&rsquo;s also different tags that you can use to make your posts more customized. It is nessaary to mention that the post will now show on your page until you set <code>draft = true</code> to <code>false</code> or you can have your post as a draft and run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo server -D
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="that-easy">That easy?</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, this is how you can create a page like this or like my <a href="armando.ooo">resume page</a> with basically only markdown and maybe LaTeX, but other knowledge is not necessary.</p>
<p>Building pages with HUGO is not a skill that will give you a job or something similar, is just something that could save you time and effort if your goal is just to show off your resume, or post silly things with a more customizable suit.</p>
